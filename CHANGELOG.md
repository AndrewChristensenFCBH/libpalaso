### Changed

- Create nuget packages
- [SIL.Media] `IAudioRecorder.SelectedDevice` now returns a `IRecordingDevice` which both the
  NAudio and AlsaAudio `RecordingDevice` implement. This allows to use to use the same assembly
  on both Windows and Linux (although the limitations what works and what doesn't work remain the
  same)

### Added

- [SIL.Core] new properties for processor architecture: `Platform.ProcessArchitecture` and
  `Platform.IsRunning64Bit`
